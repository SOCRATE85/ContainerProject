I Launched the Linux VM on AWS and installed Docker and Docker-composed
Start the Docker service:
sudo systemctl start docker.service

The reason I dont keep python 2, is because on 
the DockerHub I didnt wanted t,
I also decide to go with Alpine because it help 
me reduce the size of the image , and I think 
that the size is smaller that the other docker images 

I Opened the port 443 to the inbound traffic 
to run the docker-compose , use the command 
"docker-compose up --build "

To see the application on the browser I use the public Ip address and attached the port 
where the application is listening to : 
 - http://3.15.145.228:8080/
